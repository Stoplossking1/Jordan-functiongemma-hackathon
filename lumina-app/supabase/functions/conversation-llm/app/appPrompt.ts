const appDescription = `Lumina is an AI-powered educational app designed as a private, instant math tutor for 11–15 year-old students in low-connectivity, low-resource environments in the Global South. It addresses the lack of personalized help in crowded classrooms, unreliable internet, high latency, lack of memory of students' learning progress, data concerns, and demotivating content on cheap phones. Key features include instant photo-to-agentic math tutoring, persistent personal memory, and intelligent local-to-cloud fallback. The app embodies a warm, patient, and encouraging tone similar to a relatable big sibling, with a modern, clean, and friendly design using vibrant teal and warm orange colors. The business model is free for low-income users, with plans for revenue through B2B partnerships, a freemium model for higher-income markets, and impact funding.`;
